# Security Analysis & Hardening Guide

## üü¢ Current Security Status: **GOOD**

Your wedding events website has a strong security foundation as a static React site. Here's the complete security analysis:

## ‚úÖ **Security Strengths**

1. **Static Site Architecture**: No server-side vulnerabilities, database attacks, or server compromise risks
2. **No Exposed Secrets**: EmailJS credentials properly stored in environment variables
3. **React XSS Protection**: JSX automatically escapes user content
4. **TypeScript Safety**: Type checking prevents many runtime errors
5. **Modern Build Process**: Vite provides secure bundling and minification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Identified Risks & Mitigations**

### **1. EmailJS Client-Side Exposure (LOW-MEDIUM RISK)**

**Issue**: EmailJS public keys are visible in browser JavaScript
**Potential Impact**: Spam/abuse of your email service (limited by EmailJS quotas)

**Current Protection**:
- EmailJS has built-in rate limiting (200 emails/month on free plan)
- Keys are public keys, not private credentials
- No financial or data access risk

**Additional Hardening** (Optional):
```bash
# If you want extra protection, consider:
# 1. Vercel Functions (server-side processing)
# 2. Formspree (paid service with spam protection)
# 3. Custom API routes in Vercel for email handling
```

### **2. Content Security Policy (IMPLEMENTED)**

**Protection Added**: `vercel.json` file with comprehensive CSP
- Blocks inline scripts except from trusted sources
- Restricts external connections to EmailJS only
- Prevents clickjacking and other injection attacks

### **3. Security Headers (IMPLEMENTED)**

Added protection against:
- **Clickjacking**: X-Frame-Options: DENY
- **MIME Sniffing**: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- **XSS**: X-XSS-Protection enabled
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Strict-Transport-Security
- **Privacy**: Restrictive Permissions-Policy

## üöÄ **Deployment Security Checklist**

### **Before Going Live:**

- [ ] **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify `.env` is not committed to git
- [ ] **EmailJS Quotas**: Monitor usage in EmailJS dashboard
- [ ] **Domain Security**: Use a reputable DNS provider with DNSSEC
- [ ] **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated (`pnpm update`)

### **Ongoing Monitoring:**

- [ ] **EmailJS Dashboard**: Check for unusual activity monthly
- [ ] **Website Analytics**: Monitor for suspicious traffic patterns
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: Run `pnpm audit` quarterly
- [ ] **Content Integrity**: Verify markdown files haven't been tampered with

## üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced Security (Optional)**

### **Form Security Enhancement**

If you want additional form protection:

1. **Honeypot Fields**: Add invisible fields to catch bots
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting
3. **Captcha**: Add Google reCAPTCHA for high-value forms

### **Content Security**

1. **File Integrity**: Add checksums to critical files
2. **Content Validation**: Sanitize markdown content if accepting external contributions
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of content files

## üìä **Risk Assessment Summary**

| Risk Category | Level | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Data Breach | **VERY LOW** | No sensitive data stored |
| Email Spam | **LOW** | EmailJS quotas + monitoring |
| XSS Attacks | **VERY LOW** | React protection + CSP |
| Clickjacking | **VERY LOW** | X-Frame-Options header |
| MITM Attacks | **VERY LOW** | HTTPS enforcement |
| DDoS | **LOW** | CDN protection (Vercel) |

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**Your site is secure for production deployment.** The static architecture, modern React build, and security headers provide excellent protection for a business website. The EmailJS integration is the only minor risk, but it's well within acceptable limits for a contact form.

**Priority Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Security headers implemented
2. ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured  
3. ‚úÖ No secrets in code
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor EmailJS usage after launch

Your website follows security best practices and is ready for public deployment.
