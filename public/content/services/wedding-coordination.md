# Professional Wedding Day Coordination

Simply put ‚Äì A day-of coordinator is responsible for the flawless execution of those already-made plans. A wedding day coordinator is the essential vendor for couples who want to fully enjoy their special day without the stress of managing every detail.

## What Does a Wedding Coordinator Do?

Unlike a full-service wedding planner, a wedding coordinator focuses on the **logistics and execution** of the plans you've already made ‚Äì ensuring that everything runs smoothly from start to finish.

### **Our Coordination Philosophy:**
A wedding coordinator works for **YOU** and handles all aspects of your big day from running a church ceremony, confirming with your vendors, to creating and producing the timeline for your big day.

**Think of us like your very own wedding day insurance policy!**

## Why You Need a Wedding Coordinator

### **Even If Your Venue Has a Coordinator**

Yes, you should still consider hiring a wedding coordinator even if your venue provides an event coordinator. Although the roles can overlap, they are distinct:

- **Venue Coordinator**: Only handles tasks pertaining to the venue
- **Your Wedding Coordinator**: Handles ALL aspects of your wedding day

### **Wedding Planner vs. Coordinator**

**Full Wedding Planner:**
- Ideal for couples who prefer not to handle any planning
- Works months or years in advance
- Manages everything from booking vendors to designing the wedding

**Day-Of Wedding Coordinator:**
- Perfect for couples planning their own wedding
- Focuses on executing YOUR vision and plans
- Ensures flawless day-of coordination
