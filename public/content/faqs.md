# Your Wedding Coordination Questions Answered

## **What does a wedding coordinator do?**

Simply put ‚Äì A day-of coordinator is responsible for the flawless execution of those already-made plans. A wedding day coordinator is the essential vendor for couples who want to fully enjoy their special day without the stress of managing every detail. Unlike a full-service wedding planner, a wedding coordinator focuses on the logistics and execution of the plans you've already made ‚Äì ensuring that everything runs smoothly from start to finish.

## **My venue provides an event coordinator - do I need a wedding coordinator?**

Yes, you should still consider hiring a wedding coordinator even if your venue provides an event coordinator. Although the roles of a venue coordinator and a wedding coordinator can overlap, they are distinct and require different skill sets. A wedding coordinator works for **YOU** and handles all aspects of your big day from running a church ceremony, confirming with your vendors, to creating and producing the timeline for your big day. The venue coordinator only handles tasks pertaining to the venue. 

**Think of us like your very own wedding day insurance policy!**

## **What's the difference between a wedding planner and a coordinator?**

**Full Wedding Planner** is ideal for couples who prefer not to handle any of the planning themselves. They work with the couple months or even years in advance, managing everything from booking vendors and designing the wedding to handling the guest list and sending out invitations. 

**Day-of Wedding Coordinator** doesn't get involved in the initial planning process. Instead, we focus on executing the vision and plans of couples who are planning their own weddings.

## **How early should I hire a wedding day coordinator?**

Don't let the name fool you! Our couples book our services months or even a year in advance to secure their date. While our packages typically start at the 3- or 6-month mark, we provide monthly check-ins from the moment the contract is signed to ensure everything is on track for the big day.

## **What's the difference between traditional vs non-traditional wedding venues?**

**Traditional Wedding Venues** include a complete staff to manage all the venue aspects of your big day. This typically means a ma√Ætre d', serving staff, chefs, and bridal attendants to name a few.

**Non-Traditional Venues** require more hands-on coordination, as they don't provide these services in-house. Non-traditional venues, like parks, museums, or private homes, require you to bring in your own vendors, such as waitstaff, bartenders, and decorators. In these cases, your coordinator takes on multiple roles, including setup, coordinating with catering, and acting as your bridal attendant. Given the complexity and logistics involved, a second coordinator is required, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Additional fees apply based on venue requirements.

## **Do you offer additional services other than coordination?**

Here at Weddings\~N\~Events, we specialize solely in wedding coordination services‚Äîit's what we're known for and what we're truly passionate about! However, we do offer various add-on services such as ceremony rehearsal coordination, invitation assembly assistance, gift transport, and breakdown services.

## **What forms of payment do you accept? Do you have a payment plan?**

We accept cash and check payments. For flexibility, we offer a payment plan with two installments: a retainer due upon signing the contract and the final payment due Wednesday prior to the event date.

**If you prefer to pay in full, we offer a nice discount as an incentive to do so!**

## **Do you carry insurance?**

Yes, we carry both general and professional liability insurance and are happy to provide certificates of insurance to any venues we work with.

## **How much does a wedding coordinator cost?**

Hiring a wedding day coordinator is not only a necessity if you are planning your wedding yourself, but also is a cost-effective, personalized option that allows you to focus on enjoying your big day! The average cost of a wedding coordinator can range from $2,200 to $8,000 depending on where you're located.

**Our packages start earlier than those of most companies and include up to 12 hours of day-of service.**

## **What are the benefits of hiring a day-of coordinator for my wedding?**

Think of your Wedding Coordinator as your personal hype woman, the master of logistics, and problem solver for the big day! We'll conduct a venue walk-through with you and ask all the important questions you might not think of to your vendors/venue, helping to save you time, avoid confusion, and maybe even some money!

Your coordinator is dedicated to managing all logistics, creating and maintaining the timeline, coordinating with vendors, and resolving any issues that arise on the spot.
